== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What post types can I use this plugin on? =



The free plugin works with posts only. The premium version works with all custom post types, including woocommerce.



= The plugin doesn´t work as expected? =



In that case our algorithm wasn´t able to find in your theme the header, footer, sidebars, or content element.  So you need to use the advanced settings and enter the elements css selector.
